      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a musical collaboration by Chris Milk, Danger Mouse, etc., and 
      “3 Dreams of Black” is an interactive music film created by them. As the 
      word “interactive” shows, it is totally different from conventional and 
      traditional films/videos in that viewers can freely steer themselves and 
      change what they see as the video goes on. The video consists of 
      three parts (specifically three different dreams), and we can enjoy 
      different experiences along with background music and beautiful graphics. 
      The video itself had a significant meaning when it first appeared around 
      2011 since it showed the tremendous potential of WebGL in graphics on 
      the web. It is said to be the first interactive Web-based music film in 
      the world, and therefore it inspired lots of developers to create a new, 
      dynamic, vivid, and interactive web graphics.

      Technology:<!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->
      The most important technological feature of this film would be the use of WebGL. 
      Unlike common music videos/films, videos created and operated by WebGL work 
      based on code, and essentially what it does is rendering a bunch of visual 
      models in real-time. As the video shows, we can include many graphical components 
      such as 2D models, 3D models, and animation.
      Here, it is also worth mentioning that the WebGL is an extension of 
      JavaScript. Hence, we can easily see and learn from source code, which 
      enables us to share and develop new ideas from existing code/work. Also, 
      what WebGL requires is only HTML and JavaScript, therefore we can easily 
      enjoy interactive graphical user experiences without any special 
      software, but just with common web browsers such as Google Chrome.
