        Description: RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK" is an interactive animated short music movie. A visually stimulating and modern fantasy sped through a 21st century that is bleak and hopeful. There was a prevalent theme of light in dark, nature overtaking technology and similar contensions. All the while the viewer was strapped in or on some speeding creature, organic or mechanical, through the song and world. The film also incorporates some roughin-it, cowboy-esque film snippets weaved together with 2d drawings and most importantly, the 3d graphics.

      Technology: "3 DREAMS OF BLACK" is a collaborative music film built using WebGL in which the viewer or player can look around and experience a limited but unique visual and musical story. The RO.ME team emphasized the differences between conventional cgi and web based cgi and the agency a user can access through these relatively new web graphics tools. WebGL is a javascript extension so unlike a normal animated film that is rendered in some combination of programs that create 3d models, rigs, animations, effects, and so on , it is built entirely from code, albeit with model viewers. It is impressive how powerful yet lightweight this accelerated graphics method is - if, for instance, "3 DREAMS OF BLACK" was a video game ran stand alone I would expect my pc to work much harder for a comparable result.
