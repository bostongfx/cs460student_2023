      "ROME: 3 Dreams of Black" is an interactive web experience with the perfect combination of animation, music and user interaction. It allows the user to navigate through surreal and visually pleasing scenes. It enables the user to explore by clicking, dragging and even interacting with the elements in the scene. The visuals used portray dreamlike scenerios and are visually pleasing. For me the most eye catching visual was when the transitions took place, all of them were perfectly organised and the transitions were smoothly done. the backgroung music was also well synchronized with the visuals. Good thing that it is easily accessible through the web browser and we don't need to install any kind of software to view it. Overall, "ROME: 3 Dreams of Black" is as good as a dream but with HD vision.
